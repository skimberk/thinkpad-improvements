# Thinkpad Improvement

I just bought a used Thinkpad T440P (August 2020) and installed Ubuntu. I'm going to try and record any solutions to problems/general improvements here.

## Screen tearing when scrolling

When scrolling there would be little lines of lag across the screen. This was especially noticeable when I was scrolling through text in Firefox. I followed the instructions here which solved the issue: https://askubuntu.com/a/1111020

## Touchpad kinda wonky

The touchpad just didn't work that well. It wouldn't right click when I physically pressed the touchpad with two fingers and scrolling was a little janky. It would also right click sometimes when I was trying to select text (and therefore was clicking with two fingers on the touchpad). I followed the instructions in this answer, and it helped in some respects (scrolling is much better) but it also made some things worse (the cursors jumps around when I remove one finger after having clicked with two): https://askubuntu.com/a/1035863
